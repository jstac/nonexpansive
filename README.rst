Abstract
---------

This paper studies fitted value iteration for continuous state numerical
dynamic programming using nonexpansive function approximators.  A number of
approximation schemes are discussed.  The main contribution is to provide
error bounds for approximate optimal policies generated by the value
iteration algorithm.
